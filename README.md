# KPISystem
My final year university project that was designed for retail use to track and monitor KPIs.

This system consists of 3 elements:
1. A raspberry pi acting as a server / cloud. The aim was to make this more cloud like at the time by having most of the processing done on the cloud.

2. A mobile app for usage of the system. This is where users would submit sales and view their own and store performance.

3. A Desktop app for usage and initial setting up of the system.

The aim of the project was to be an overall system that could be used within a retail environment to monitor sales and help stores hit their targets and KPIs.

This was my Final Year Project for my BSc degree. It consisted of Java, Python and PHP for all of the elements. I got a 1st overall for this project (Note: The mark was fully based on the document that was submitted, not the code itself)
